# Microbial Response to Climate Change
This project is a statistical analysis and multiple comparison of microbial responses to climate change in Tibetan alpine meadows.

### Abstract
  Microbial necromass carbon (MNC) plays a significant role in nutrient cycling and is an especially large contributor to soil organic matter. (Cai et al., 2023) explored the dynamics of MNC across different warming groups in a Tibetan alpine meadow, and found that low-level (+0–1.5°C) warming mostly enhanced the accumulation of MNC compared to the control group. However, the effects of soil layer and interactions between soil physiochemical properties and their contribution to bacterial necromass carbon (BNC) in particular were not explored as in depth. In this paper, I aimed to address this by examining BNC production across different soil layers and by establishing a linear model to describe the relationship between soil properties and BNC levels. Through statistical analyses, including one-way ANOVA and linear regression modeling, we found a significant difference in BNC levels among different soil layers. The results indicated that soil physiochemical properties partially explain the variability observed in BNC levels. Overall, my findings can provide valuable insights into the variation of BNC with soil levels and highlight the importance of abiotic factors in shaping BNC dynamics.


### Introduction
  The Tibetan Plateau is estimated to contain 2% to 3% of the earth's soil organic carbon (Shang et al., 2016). The data collected by (Cai et al., 2023) contained information from a Tibetan alpine meadow about different abiotic factors such as soil physiochemical properties (pH, soil moisture, etc.), different biotic factors (bacterial necromass carbon, fungal necromass carbon, etc.), as well as different treatment groups and soil levels. The relationship between the treatment groups the direct and indirect effects that warming had on the total MNC and its contribution to soil organic carbon was explored in (Cai et al., 2023). To deepen the understanding of the interactions between aboitic and biotic factors on the accumulation of BNC specifically, the complete effects of soil layer must be understood. Soil layer is a large contributor to the availability of nutrients including organic matter distribution in an ecosystem. As a result, soil layer can have large effects on microbial activity and the accumulation of bacterial necromass carbon in an ecosystem. Classical modelling of carbon sequestration places assumptions that soil organic carbon (SOC) is mainly derived from plant root and litter residues (Kallenbach et al., 2016). However, recent evidence suggests the importance of microbial sources of carbon, where microbial processes and life cycles are essential to the stability of soil SOC. By improving our understanding of microbial contributions to soil carbon pools, we can shed further light on the transformation of SOC (Bardgett et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2016).
  
  By specifically investigating the variations in bacterial necromass carbon across different soil layers, this study aims to shed light on the specific effects of soil layer on BNC dynamics. This knowledge is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions between abiotic and biotic factors and their combined influence on microbial activity and the accumulation of BNCithin the ecosystem.Understanding the intricate relationships between soil layers and BNC accumulation can have significant implications for nutrient cycling processes, carbon sequestration, and overall ecosystem sustainability. Moreover, by describing the specific effects of soil layer on BNC, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge surrounding microbial contributions to soil carbon dynamics.

## Statistical Methods

#### ANOVA: Comparing the mean BNC between soil layers

  To assess the variance of means between soil layers, I performed a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In analysis of variance, the total variation in the data is comprised of two components: the variation between groups and the variation within groups. The between group variation quantifies the differences between the means of the groups, while the within group variation quantifies the differences within each group and is associated with random error or individual variability. The sum of squares are then calculated. The sum of squares between (SSB) quantifies the variation between the group means, and is given by $$SSB = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i (\bar{X}_i - \bar{X})^2$$ and the sum of squares within (SSW) represents the variation within each group and is given by $$SSW = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (X_{ij} - \bar{X}_i)^2$$ The mean square between (MSB) and mean square within are then calculated with the following formulas, where the degrees of freedom between is given by the number of groups minus one and degrees of freedom within is given by the total number of observations minus the number of groups. $$MSB = \frac{SSB}{dfb} \quad \quad MSW = \frac{SSW}{dfw}$$
The F statistic is calculated as the ratio of the MSB to MSW, which is then compared to the F distribution with dfb and dfw degrees of freedom to obtain a p value.

  The assumptions of ANOVA are that the data comes from random samples, the groups are each normally distributed, and the groups have equal variances. The data was collected from root samples which were randomly selected from a subplot of 0.2m x 0.2m in the Field Observation and Research Station of Alpine Grassland Ecosystem of Tibet, China (Cai, et al., 2023). The data was log transformed, and did not yield a significant p value (p > 0.05) for the Shapiro Wilk test, indicating that the data is normally distributed. Finally, the homoscedasticity was assessed with the Levene Test, which also did not yield a significant p value (p > 0.05), indicating equal variance. Thus all the assumptions are met. The null hypothesis of this ANOVA is that there is no difference in any of the means across soil layer groups. Thus, the alternative hypothesis is that there is a mean difference in at least one of the means across soil layers.


#### Model: Predicting BNC 
  I used a linear model to describe the effects of the soil layer and the physiochemical properties of the soil on BNC, which was used to predict BNC given the features. In general, this technique is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The linear model aims to estimate the coefficients that represent the effect of each predictor on the BNC. The general form of a linear regression model is: $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_pX_p + \varepsilon$$ where there are some coefficients multiplied by the predictors plus an intercept and an error term. The regression coefficients are estimated using the least squares method given by: $$\hat{\beta} = (X^\top X)^{-1} X^\top Y$$ where Y is the vector of observed values for the dependent variable, $X^\top$ is the transpose of the design matrix X, and $(X^\top X)^{-1}$ is the inverse of the matrix product of the transpose of X. This minimizes the sum of squared residuals resulting in the best fit line through the data. 
  
  The assumptions for linear regression are that there is a linear relationship between the predictor(s) and the response variable, the resuduals are normally distributed, no multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity of residuals. All predictors have linear relationships with BNC, and the residuals are normally distributed (Shapiro Wilk p > 0.05) and as seen in plot (b) of Figure 3. However, the predictors are highly correlated. In order to deal with this, I performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the predictors that are soil physiochemical properties (pH, SM, STN). PCA essentially allows for the identification of underlying patterns and relationships by transforming the original variables into a new, reduced dimension set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The principal components are calculated based on the covariance or correlation matrix of the preprocessed data, where the covariance matrix measures the pairwise covariances between variables, while the correlation matrix measures the pairwise correlations. For example, covariance is calculated by: $$\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})$$ Next, eigendecomposition is performed to yield a set of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. Then the eigenvalues are sorted in descending order to determine their importance and the principal component score is calculated by the dot product: $$PC_{ij} = \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j$$ where $\mathbf{x}_i$ represents the centered and scaled values of the ith observation, and $\mathbf{v}_j$ denotes the jth eigenvector. Principal components are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated. This allows for the multicollinearity assumption to be met. For this model, I used the first two principal components which collectively describe 95% of the variance. Finally, the homoscedasticity is assessed with the Levene test (p > 0.05) and the residual vs fitted plot of Figure 3, implying equal variance. Therefore, the assumptions are met for each test. The null hypothesis of this is that there is no significant relationship between the predictors and the response variable. Thus, the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant relationship between the predictors and the response variable.
